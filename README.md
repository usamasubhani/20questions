## How it works
A **Binary Tree** is implemented such that every non-leaf node is a question and every leaf node  is an answers.
Each question will eliminate half of the possibilities. User can answer question by moving his head right/left for yes/no.

[Accord.NET](https://github.com/accord-net/framework) is used for face movement detection.


## Playing Instructions
Think of something and BrainReader will read
your mind by asking a few simple questions.
Move your head to the right if your answer is Yes,
Move your head to the left if your answer is No, 
The object you think of should be something 
that most people would know about, but 
not a proper noun. If BrainReader fails to read your 
mind, it will ask for your help to improve its power.
